What changes were made to the above code/scripts to support the new architecture?
Relative to v1.1.0, the forecast job was sped up by allocating more nodes, cores 
and RAM. This was done due to code profiling by GDIT showing a memory bottleneck:

Old:
#PBS -l select=6:ncpus=128:mem=150GB
export mpicmd='mpiexec -n 768 -ppn 128'

New:
#PBS -l select=12:ncpus=128:mem=500GB
export mpicmd='mpiexec -n 768 -ppn 64 --depth 2 --cpu-bind depth'

Were any other changes made that aren’t directly related to the transition?
No

Are there any changes to incoming data needs or outgoing products? 
No

If output filenames are changing, list the current and new filename
N/A

*** Providing PBS and/or ecFlow submission scripts as part of release tag is preferred; 
if they are provided then resource information is not needed in the release notes.
